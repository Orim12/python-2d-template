# 🧰 Python Project Template Collection

This repository provides a **collection of Python project templates** you can use as-is or customize to your needs.

Whether you're starting a 2D game using `pygame`, a script, or any other Python-based project, this template system will scaffold everything for you — including folder structure, virtual environments, dependencies, and optionally a basic working example.
it is community driven so feel free to add your own template so that others may use it

```

if folder is already created run in folder
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Orim12/python-2d-template/refs/heads/main/run.sh | bash
```
•	Replace my_game_name with your desired project folder name (optional).<br>
• If the folder doesn’t exist, it will be created for you.<br>
