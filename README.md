# 🕹️ Python 2D Game Project Template

A simple shell script to instantly scaffold a clean Python 2D game project using `pygame`.<br>
It sets up folders, a virtual environment, dependencies, and a basic game loop — so you can start building immediately.

## 🚀 Quick Start

###Open your terminal and run:<br>
if you need to create the folder run
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Orim12/python-2d-template/refs/heads/main/run.sh | bash -s my_game_name
```

if folder is already created run in folder
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Orim12/python-2d-template/refs/heads/main/run.sh | bash
```
•	Replace my_game_name with your desired project folder name (optional).<br>
• If the folder doesn’t exist, it will be created for you.<br>
•	If omitted, it uses the current directory and scaffolds everything there.<br>
